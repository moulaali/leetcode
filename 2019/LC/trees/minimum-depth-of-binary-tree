/**

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
return its minimum depth = 2.

Approach

1/ Find min in lst and rst and return 1 + min.

Better approach

Instead of walking all the tree, do a level-order walk and return the level first time we hit leaf.
level can be incremented after each queue drain check.
