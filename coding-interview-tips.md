 **Before you start**
  
  * Move fast. Do not spend too much time for previous projects and experience.
  * Ask clarifying questions before jumping to answer


  **Coding**
  * Naming
    * Keep short names : s (for string), max, len, l, r (left and right) etc. 
  * Making it work
    * Start with simple examples. Don't input large testcase. the output will overwhelm you.
    * Add more cases incrementally
    * Break into small functions and test each one before writing the whole program.
    * Dont wait till the end to test. Test/Validate your thinking often with logging.
  * Verification
    * Important to run few test cases and edge cases at the end.
  * Logging
    * Dont overlog but log at strategic places to start with.
    * if you are stuck, simplify the input and add more logs. remove them once the issue is fixed 
  * Comments
    * One liners that are brief and at right places 
  * Manually verify the logic to make sure there are no bugs
  * Have it working before you optimize (Better done than perfect)
  * Cleanup
     * Cleanup the code at the end : Remove unnecessary comments, imports, blanklines etc.
     * Keep the least minimum code that works clearly. Its ok to be messsy during troubleshooting
     * If you have time, make it beautiful.
   
**Solve unknown problems**
  * Start with what you know, its fine to optimize the edge cases as we try out tests.
  * Write helper methods to print and do useful things.
  * HARD PROBLEMS can still be solved. YES, YOU CAN TRY !
  * SOLVE manually and see how you are solving. see if there is a possiblity of optimization
  * Try to relate with other standard patterns: Graph search, tree, stack etc

**Communication**
  * Share what you are thinking while coding
  * If you are badly stuck and running out of time, ok to ask for few hints.

**Debugging/Troubleshooting**
  * Take simpler test case : smaller array with 3-4 elements, happy case, simple tree with few nodes
  * Infinite loops in functions: have a static function counter that is incremented after every call. exit after count == 10
  * Manually go over the logic to see silly mistakes
