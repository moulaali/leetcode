  **Before you start**
  
  * Move fast. Do not spend too much time for previous projects and experience.
  * Ask clarifying questions before jumping to answer


  **Coding**
  * Keep simple names. (length, input, start, end, max, etc)
  * Break into small functions and test each one before writing the whole program.
  * Dont wait till the end to test. Test/Validate your thinking often with logging.
  * Log important flow conditions with var values. Use String.format() for ease.
  * start with simple case and make it work. iterate for complexity
  * Manually verify the logic to make sure there are no bugs
  * Do not add too many comments. wastes your time. one liners are fine
  * import java.util.* instead of multiple import
  * Have it working before you optimize (Better done than perfect)
   
**Solve unknown problems**
  * SOLVE manually and see how you are solving. see if there is a possiblity of optimization
  * Try to relate with other standard patterns: Graph search, tree, stack etc

**Communication**
  * Share what you are thinking while coding
